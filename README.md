- Despite Netflix’s international expansion, the content remains heavily U.S.-centric, pointing to a regional concentration that may need diversification.
- The limited output from individual directors shows a broad creative pool rather than reliance on a few big names.

## Final Observation and Recommendation

#### Analysis Observation

- Netflix has significantly scaled its content production over the past decade, setting new standards in digital media distribution.
- A strong emphasis is placed on mature-rated content and episodic TV shows, reflecting evolving viewer consumption patterns.
- The current distribution shows an underrepresentation of general audience and youth-friendly content.
- Western regions, particularly the U.S., dominate content creation, while other regions remain under-leveraged.

#### Analysis Recommendation

- For Content Creators: Consider developing content within high-demand genres such as Drama, Comedy, and Action, with themes geared toward mature audiences.
- For Netflix Strategists: Diversify content sourcing by increasing investments in underrepresented regions, especially in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.
- For Data Analysts: Use Excel’s filtering, pivoting, and visualization tools for similar trend analysis across other streaming or content datasets.
- For Developers & Marketers: Introduce more inclusive and family-oriented content to attract a broader demographic spectrum.
- For Industry Stakeholders: Benchmark against the 2015–2024 period, which represents the most competitive and transformative era in Netflix’s history.
